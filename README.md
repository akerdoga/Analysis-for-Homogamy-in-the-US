# Analysis-for-Homogamy-in-the-US
The dataset used in this homework is created by Institute for Social Research- Survey Research Center. It is gathered within the scope of The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), which is the longest running longitudinal household survey in the world. It offers significant insights into the work and household dynamics of married individuals in the United States.
The sample size of 753 observations, it provides a comprehensive view of various factors that influence work patterns and family dynamics.
I've chosen this dataset to examine homogamy in the US in 1970s since it provides insights about employment, income, education level of spouses and the family background of women.
